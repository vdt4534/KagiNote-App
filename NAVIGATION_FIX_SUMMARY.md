# Navigation Fix Summary

## Problem
The sidebar navigation buttons (Dashboard, New Recording, etc.) were not functional - clicking on them didn't navigate between screens.

## Root Cause
The Sidebar component was rendering navigation items but they weren't connected to any navigation logic. The onClick handlers were not being passed from the parent components.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AppLayout Component
- Added `onNavigate` prop to handle navigation callbacks
- Added `currentScreen` prop to highlight the active navigation item
- Connected sidebar items to actual navigation handlers

### 2. Updated App.tsx
- Created `handleNavigation` function to manage screen transitions
- Passed navigation handler to AppLayout
- Passed current screen state for active item highlighting

### 3. Connected Sidebar Navigation
- Dashboard button → navigates to dashboard screen
- New Recording button → opens new meeting modal
- Transcripts button → navigates to dashboard (where transcripts are shown)
- Settings button → ready for future implementation

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/layout/AppLayout.tsx`
   - Added navigation props
   - Connected sidebar sections with onClick handlers
   - Set active state based on current screen

2. `src/App.tsx`
   - Added handleNavigation function
   - Fixed missing AppState properties
   - Connected navigation to state management

## How It Works Now
1. **From Recording to Dashboard**: Click "Dashboard" in sidebar → sets currentScreen to 'dashboard'
2. **From Dashboard to Recording**: Click "New Recording" → opens new meeting modal
3. **Active State**: Current screen is highlighted in the sidebar
4. **Stop Recording**: Automatically returns to dashboard

## Testing the Fix
1. Start the app
2. Click "New Recording" in the sidebar → Should open new meeting modal
3. Start a recording → Should show recording screen
4. Click "Dashboard" in sidebar → Should return to dashboard
5. Stop recording → Should automatically return to dashboard

## Benefits
- ✅ Sidebar navigation is now fully functional
- ✅ Clear visual feedback for the current screen
- ✅ Consistent navigation patterns throughout the app
- ✅ Ready for additional screens (Settings, etc.)
