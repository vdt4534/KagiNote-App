# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

KagiNote is a privacy-focused meeting transcription application built with Tauri v2, React 19, and TypeScript. The app runs locally to ensure privacy and uses Rust for the backend with audio processing capabilities.

## Architecture

**Hybrid Desktop App Structure:**
- `src/` - React frontend with TypeScript
- `src-tauri/` - Rust backend with Tauri v2 framework
- Frontend communicates with Rust backend through Tauri's invoke API

**Key Dependencies:**
- **Frontend**: React 19, Radix UI themes, Tailwind CSS v3, WaveSurfer.js for audio visualization
- **Backend**: Tauri v2, cpal for audio capture, hound for audio file handling, tokio for async operations
- **Build Tools**: Vite for frontend bundling, PostCSS for CSS processing, TypeScript compiler
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 with PostCSS and Autoprefixer integration

## Development Commands

**Frontend Development:**
```bash
npm run dev          # Start Vite dev server (port 1420)
npm run build        # Build frontend (tsc + vite build)
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

**Tauri Development:**
```bash
npm run tauri dev    # Start Tauri dev mode (auto-launches app)
npm run tauri build  # Build production app bundle
```

## Parallel Development with Git Worktrees

For running multiple Claude Code sessions simultaneously with complete code isolation:

**Create and manage worktrees:**
```bash
# Create a new worktree with a new branch
git worktree add ../kaginote-feature-a -b feature-a

# Or create a worktree with an existing branch
git worktree add ../kaginote-bugfix bugfix-123

# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove a worktree when done
git worktree remove ../kaginote-feature-a
```

**Run Claude Code in each worktree:**
```bash
# Navigate to your worktree
cd ../kaginote-feature-a

# Set up environment for each worktree
source ~/.cargo/env
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.15
pnpm install

# Run Claude Code in this isolated environment
claude
```

**Benefits:**
- Each worktree has independent file state, perfect for parallel Claude Code sessions
- Changes in one worktree won't affect others, preventing interference between Claude instances
- All worktrees share the same Git history and remote connections
- Long-running tasks can run in one worktree while continuing development in another
- Use descriptive directory names to identify which task each worktree handles

## Troubleshooting

### Transcription Not Showing
If transcription shows placeholder text instead of actual speech:
1. Check that Whisper models are downloaded: `~/Library/Application Support/KagiNote/models/`
2. Run with debug logging: `RUST_LOG=debug npm run tauri dev`
3. Verify microphone permissions in System Settings
4. Ensure you speak for at least 2 seconds (1.5s minimum buffer)

### Monitor Transcription Events
In browser console:
```javascript
window.__TAURI__.event.listen('transcription-update', (event) => {
  console.log('Transcription:', event.payload);
});
```

## Speaker Diarization (Production Ready)

KagiNote V2 includes advanced speaker diarization capabilities for identifying and separating multiple speakers in real-time during meetings.

### CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT

**⚠️ MUST USE pyannote-rs - NEVER CREATE CUSTOM IMPLEMENTATIONS ⚠️**

The speaker diarization MUST use pyannote-rs or its direct ONNX models. Do NOT attempt to create custom embedding extraction or diarization implementations. The current implementation uses ONNX Runtime directly due to temporary compatibility issues with pyannote-rs, but it follows the exact pyannote approach.

### Dependency Resolution History (IMPORTANT)

We encountered and resolved critical dependency issues with pyannote-rs:

**Problem:** pyannote-rs v0.3.1 has incompatibility with ort (ONNX Runtime) versions
- Error: `SessionInputValue From ArrayBase` type mismatches
- Cause: pyannote-rs expects ort v2.0.0-rc.10 but has API incompatibilities
- The altunenes fork with "Update-ort-dependency-to-rc.10" branch also had build issues

**Solution Implemented:**
```toml
# src-tauri/Cargo.toml
# Using direct ONNX runtime with compatible version
ort = { version = "1.16", default-features = false, features = ["download-binaries", "coreml"] }
ndarray = "0.15"
```

**Why This Works:**
1. Uses stable ort 1.16 instead of release candidate versions
2. Implements the exact pyannote segmentation and embedding approach
3. Loads the same ONNX models (segmentation-3.0.onnx, wespeaker embeddings)
4. Maintains compatibility while pyannote-rs resolves its dependency issues

**Future Migration Path:**
When pyannote-rs resolves ort compatibility, migrate back by:
1. Replacing ort 1.16 with pyannote-rs latest version
2. Using pyannote-rs's get_segments() and embedding functions directly
3. Removing manual ONNX session management code

### Feature Overview

- **Real-time Speaker Identification**: Detect up to 8 speakers simultaneously during recording
- **Speaker Profile Management**: Create, update, and manage persistent speaker profiles with custom names and colors
- **Embedding-based Recognition**: Uses 512-dimensional speaker embeddings for accurate voice identification
- **Adaptive Clustering**: Automatic speaker clustering with configurable similarity thresholds
- **Voice Characteristics**: Extracts pitch, formant frequencies, speaking rate, and energy levels
- **Overlapping Speech Detection**: Identifies when multiple speakers talk simultaneously
- **Privacy-first Processing**: All speaker models and data processed entirely locally

### Configuration Options

**Basic Configuration:**
```rust
DiarizationConfig {
    max_speakers: 8,           // Maximum speakers to detect (2-10)
    min_speakers: 2,           // Minimum speakers expected (1-10)  
    similarity_threshold: 0.7, // Speaker clustering threshold (0.0-1.0)
    min_segment_duration: 1.0, // Minimum segment length in seconds
    hardware_acceleration: Auto, // Auto, CPU, Metal, CUDA
}
```

**Advanced Settings:**
```rust
// Voice Activity Detection
vad_threshold: 0.5,           // Speech detection sensitivity (0.0-1.0)
detect_overlaps: true,        // Enable overlapping speech detection

// Performance Tuning
embedding_window_size: 3000,  // Window size for embeddings (ms)
max_memory_mb: 500,          // Memory limit for processing
enable_adaptive_clustering: true, // Dynamic clustering adjustment
```

### Testing Commands

npm run test:e2e -- tests/e2e/speaker-diarization-e2e.spec.ts

# Run with UI for debugging
npm run test:e2e:ui -- --grep="speaker identification"
```

**Debug and Monitoring:**
```bash
# Start with debug logging
RUST_LOG=debug,kaginote::diarization=trace npm run tauri dev

# Monitor diarization events in browser console
window.__TAURI__.event.listen('speaker-detected', (event) => {
  console.log('New speaker:', event.payload);
});

window.__TAURI__.event.listen('speaker-activity', (event) => {
  console.log('Speaker activity:', event.payload);
});
```

### Troubleshooting Guide

**Speaker Not Detected:**
1. Check minimum segment duration (must speak for >1 second)
2. Verify VAD threshold is appropriate for audio quality
3. Ensure sufficient speaker separation in audio
4. Check debug logs: `RUST_LOG=kaginote::diarization=debug`

**Poor Speaker Separation:**
1. Adjust similarity threshold (lower = more speakers detected)
2. Increase embedding window size for better accuracy
3. Enable adaptive clustering for dynamic environments
4. Check for audio quality issues (noise, echo)

**Performance Issues:**
1. Reduce max_speakers if not needed
2. Increase min_segment_duration to reduce processing
3. Disable overlap detection if not required
4. Monitor memory usage with max_memory_mb setting

**Memory Warnings:**
```bash
# Check current memory usage
cargo test memory_usage_test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- --nocapture

# Reduce memory footprint
let config = DiarizationConfig {
    max_memory_mb: 256,  // Reduce from default 500MB
    max_speakers: 4,     // Reduce from default 8
    ..Default::default()
};
```

**Debug Speaker Storage:**
```bash
# Initialize speaker database
cargo test initialize_speaker_storage --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml

# Test embedding similarity
cargo test find_similar_speakers --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml

# Clear all speaker data for fresh start
cargo test clear_all_speaker_data --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
```
