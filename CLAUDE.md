# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

KagiNote is a privacy-focused meeting transcription application built with Tauri v2, React 19, and TypeScript. The app runs locally to ensure privacy and uses Rust for the backend with audio processing capabilities.

## Architecture

**Hybrid Desktop App Structure:**
- `src/` - React frontend with TypeScript
- `src-tauri/` - Rust backend with Tauri v2 framework
- Frontend communicates with Rust backend through Tauri's invoke API

**Key Dependencies:**
- **Frontend**: React 19, Radix UI themes, Tailwind CSS v3, WaveSurfer.js for audio visualization
- **Backend**: Tauri v2, cpal for audio capture, hound for audio file handling, tokio for async operations
- **Build Tools**: Vite for frontend bundling, PostCSS for CSS processing, TypeScript compiler
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 with PostCSS and Autoprefixer integration

## Development Commands

**Frontend Development:**
```bash
npm run dev          # Start Vite dev server (port 1420)
npm run build        # Build frontend (tsc + vite build)
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

**Tauri Development:**
```bash
npm run tauri dev    # Start Tauri dev mode (auto-launches app)
npm run tauri build  # Build production app bundle
```

**Package Management:**
```bash
pnpm install         # Install dependencies (uses pnpm)
```

**Build Requirements:**
```bash
# Required for whisper.cpp integration
brew install cmake

# Verify Rust environment
source ~/.cargo/env
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.15
cargo check
```

**Styling Development:**
```bash
# Tailwind CSS is configured with PostCSS and processes automatically during:
npm run dev          # Development with hot reload
npm run build        # Production build with optimization
# Configuration files: tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js
```

## Audio Processing Architecture

The app is designed for audio capture and processing with universal device compatibility:
- **Universal Device Support**: Automatic sample rate detection and conversion for any audio device
- **Real-time Resampling**: Linear interpolation resampling (any rate → 16kHz for Whisper compatibility)
- **Device Intelligence**: Built-in profiles for MacBook Pro/Air, iMac microphones with optimal settings
- **Cross-platform Audio**: `cpal` for cross-platform audio capture with fallback mechanisms
- **Audio Processing**: `hound` library for WAV operations, `tokio` for async streaming
- **Frontend Visualization**: WaveSurfer.js connected to real backend audio levels
