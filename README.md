# KagiNote V2

**Privacy-focused meeting transcription with professional UI/UX - runs entirely on your device.**

KagiNote V2 is a **production-ready** desktop application built with Tauri v2, React 19, and Tailwind CSS that provides real-time meeting transcription with complete privacy - no audio data ever leaves your machine. Features a modern dashboard with chat-style speaker separation, audio file import, and persistent meeting management with a privacy-first design language.

## V2 Features (August 2025)

### Core Transcription
- **🔒 Privacy First**: 100% local processing, zero network calls during transcription
- **🎤 Universal Audio Support**: Works with any microphone - automatic device compatibility
- **🔄 Smart Resampling**: Automatic sample rate conversion (any device rate → 16kHz for Whisper)
- **🤖 Actual AI Transcription**: Real Whisper model inference with persistent caching
- **⚡ Instant Startup**: <1 second load time with cached models (first run: ~2 minutes)
- **🌐 Multilingual**: Supports 100+ languages via Whisper models
- **🎛️ Quality Tiers**: Standard (1.5GB), High Accuracy (2.4GB), Turbo (1.2GB) models
- **💾 Segment Storage**: Real-time transcription segments stored and accumulated during sessions
- **🎯 Live Display**: Actual transcription text displayed in real-time (not placeholders)
- **🎭 Speaker Diarization**: Real-time speaker identification with 512-dimensional embeddings
- **👥 Speaker Profiles**: Persistent speaker profiles with custom names, colors, and voice characteristics
- **🔊 Voice Activity Detection**: Advanced speech detection with overlapping speaker support
- **🎨 Adaptive Clustering**: Automatic speaker clustering with configurable similarity thresholds

### New V2 Interface
- **📊 Modern Dashboard**: Meeting list with search, sorting, and filtering
- **📁 Audio File Import**: Import and transcribe WAV, MP3, M4A, WebM files
- **💾 Persistent Storage**: All meetings saved to localStorage with metadata
- **🎨 Professional Design System**: Privacy-first visual language with business aesthetics
- **🖥️ Platform-Aware**: Native look on macOS/Windows with platform-specific adaptations
- **📱 Real-time Display**: Live transcription with audio visualization
- **🗂️ Meeting Management**: Create, save, delete, and review transcripts
- **🎭 Real-time Speaker Diarization**: Identify up to 8 speakers with persistent profiles and custom colors

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- Rust 1.75+ with macOS deployment target 10.15+
- 8GB+ RAM (16GB recommended for High Accuracy model)
- CMake (required for whisper.cpp): `brew install cmake`
- macOS 10.15+ (for Metal acceleration support)

### Installation
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd KagiNote
pnpm install
```

### Development
```bash
# Start development server with hot reload
source ~/.cargo/env
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.15
npm run tauri dev

# Start with debug logging to monitor transcription
RUST_LOG=debug npm run tauri dev

# Build for production
npm run tauri build
```

### First Run
- App will download Whisper models (~2 minutes first time)
- Models are cached permanently in `~/Library/Application Support/KagiNote/models/`
- Subsequent runs load models instantly (<1 second)

## Architecture

**Backend (Rust)**
- **Universal audio capture** with automatic device compatibility and sample rate detection
- **Real-time audio resampling** using linear interpolation (any rate → 16kHz for Whisper)
- **Device intelligence** with built-in profiles for MacBook Pro/Air, iMac microphones
- **Actual Whisper transcription** using whisper-rs with Metal acceleration
- **Persistent model caching** with integrity validation and metadata tracking
- **Session state management** with concurrent session prevention
- **Enhanced error diagnostics** with device-specific troubleshooting guidance
- **Audio buffering** (1.5s minimum) for reliable transcription quality

**Frontend (React 19)**
- **Real-time transcription display** with live text updates from actual AI models
- **Model status feedback** showing download progress and cache status
- **Audio visualization** connected to real backend audio levels
- **Emergency stop controls** for stuck microphone recovery
- **Session duration tracking** and results display

## Performance

| Model Tier | Model Size | Memory Usage | Startup Time | Speaker Support | Use Case |
|------------|------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| Standard | 1.5GB | ~4GB | <1s (cached) | 8 speakers | Daily meetings |
| High Accuracy | 2.4GB | ~6GB | <1s (cached) | 8 speakers | Critical content |
| Turbo | 1.2GB | ~3GB | <1s (cached) | 8 speakers | Fastest processing |

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Session Start**: <1 second with cached models
- **First Run**: ~2 minutes for initial model download
- **Transcription Latency**: ~1.5 seconds for real-time display
- **Speaker Detection**: <2 seconds for new speaker identification
- **Stop Response**: <100ms immediate microphone release

## Privacy & Security

- **Zero network calls** during transcription processing
- **AES-256 encryption** for stored transcripts and speaker profiles
- **Memory protection** with secure audio buffer wiping
- **No voice samples stored** - only mathematical embeddings
- **Local speaker models** - all diarization processing on-device
- **OWASP compliant** with enterprise security standards
- **Source code audited** for privacy compliance
