# Real-Time Speaker Diarization Test Infrastructure Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive test infrastructure has been created for testing real-time speaker diarization functionality.

## What Was Created

### Test Infrastructure Location
src-tauri/tests/diarization_realtime/

### Key Components
1. Audio Playback Simulator - Simulates real-time audio streaming
2. Validation Framework - Measures accuracy with DER metrics
3. Test Scenarios - 6 predefined test cases
4. Synthetic Audio Generator - Creates test audio files
5. Test Scripts - Automated test execution and reporting

### Performance Targets
- Real-time Factor: <1.5x
- Latency: <2.0s
- Memory Usage: <500MB
- DER: <15%
- Speaker Accuracy: >85%

## How to Run Tests

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x src-tauri/tests/diarization_realtime/*.sh

# Generate test audio
./src-tauri/tests/diarization_realtime/download_test_data.sh --synthetic-only

# Run tests
./src-tauri/tests/diarization_realtime/run_tests_simple.sh

## Test Results Location
Reports saved in: src-tauri/tests/diarization_realtime/reports/
