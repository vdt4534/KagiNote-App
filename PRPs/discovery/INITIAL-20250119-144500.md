            return Err(ValidationError::EmptyAudio);
        }
        
        // Check for clipping or invalid values
        for &sample in &self.samples {
            if sample < -1.0 || sample > 1.0 {
                return Err(ValidationError::ClippedAudio);
            }

## 9. Testing Strategy

### 9.1 Test Coverage Requirements

#### Unit Test Coverage
- **Target Coverage**: 95% code coverage for critical paths
- **Core Components**: Audio processing, ASR engines, VAD, diarization
- **Test Types**: Unit tests, property-based tests, benchmark tests

```rust
// Example unit test structure
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[tokio::test]
    async fn test_vad_speech_detection_accuracy() {
        let audio = AudioTestFactory::create_speech_with_silence();
        let vad = SileroVAD::new().unwrap();
        
        let results = vad.process(&audio).await.unwrap();
        
        // Verify speech detection accuracy
        assert!(results.speech_ratio > 0.6 && results.speech_ratio < 0.8);
        assert!(results.false_positive_rate < 0.05);
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn test_whisper_medium_performance() {
        let audio = AudioTestFactory::create_clean_speech(60.0); // 1 minute
        let model = WhisperModel::medium().unwrap();
        
        let start = Instant::now();
        let result = model.transcribe(&audio).unwrap();
        let duration = start.elapsed();
        
        // Verify real-time factor
        let rtf = duration.as_secs_f64() / audio.duration_seconds();
        assert!(rtf < 1.0, "RTF should be less than 1.0 for real-time processing");
        
        // Verify accuracy (using known ground truth)
        let wer = calculate_word_error_rate(&result.text, &EXPECTED_TEXT);
        assert!(wer < 0.12, "WER should be less than 12% for clean speech");
    }
}
```

- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Implement real-time thermal monitoring
  - Automatic model tier downgrading at temperature thresholds
  - User notification and cooling period enforcement
  - **Test Strategy**: Sustained load testing with thermal simulation
  - **Success Criteria**: Graceful degradation with <20% performance loss

**Risk RT-002: Memory Exhaustion Crashes**

- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Multiple capture method fallbacks (WASAPI → WDM → Virtual Cable)
  - Clear user guidance for IT department requests
  - Browser extension alternative for web meetings
  - **Test Strategy**: Testing on locked-down enterprise Windows/macOS systems
  - **Success Criteria**: At least one capture method works in >90% of environments

#### Medium-Impact Technical Risks

  - Continuous learning from user corrections
  - **Test Strategy**: Accent variation testing and multilingual meeting scenarios
  - **Success Criteria**: <10% misclassification rate on test dataset

**Risk RT-005: Speaker Diarization Instability**
- **Impact**: Medium - Speaker confusion reduces transcript usability  
- **Probability**: Medium - Similar voices and cross-talk challenging
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Median filtering to prevent speaker label flipping
  - Fallback to single-speaker mode when confidence low
  - User controls for manual speaker assignment
  - **Test Strategy**: Similar voice testing and cross-talk scenarios
  - **Success Criteria**: <15% Diarization Error Rate (DER) for 2-4 speakers

### 10.2 Business Risks

**Risk RB-001: Competitive Model Performance Gap**
- **Impact**: High - Users switch to cloud services for better accuracy
- **Probability**: Medium - Cloud models improve faster than local
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Rapid integration of new open-source models (Whisper updates)

  - **Success Criteria**: Maintain WER within 20% of best cloud services

**Risk RB-002: Hardware Requirements Exclude Target Users**
- **Impact**: High - Reduces addressable market
- **Probability**: Medium - AI models are resource-intensive
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Multiple quality tiers including "Draft" mode for low-end hardware
  - Clear minimum requirements communication
  - Cloud fallback option (opt-in) for unsupported hardware
  - **Success Criteria**: Support 80% of business laptops from last 3 years

### 10.3 Legal and Compliance Risks

**Risk RL-001: Model License Violations**
- **Impact**: Critical - Legal liability and forced removal of models
- **Probability**: Low - But high impact if occurs
- **Mitigation Strategy**:

  - Alternative model preparation for license-restricted components
  - **Success Criteria**: All models cleared for commercial use

**Risk RL-002: Privacy Law Compliance (GDPR/CCPA)**
- **Impact**: High - Legal penalties and market exclusion
- **Probability**: Low - Local processing helps, but data handling matters
- **Mitigation Strategy**:
  - Privacy-by-design architecture with local-only processing
  - User consent for any data retention or sharing
  - Data deletion capabilities and audit trails
  - **Success Criteria**: Full compliance verification from legal counsel

This comprehensive requirements document provides the foundation for test-driven development of KagiNote. Every functional requirement includes specific test scenarios, acceptance criteria, and performance targets that enable writing meaningful failing tests before implementation. The non-functional requirements establish measurable quality gates, while the risk assessment and implementation phases provide a clear roadmap for delivering a production-ready privacy-first transcription system.

The document is structured to support iterative development with continuous validation against user needs and technical constraints. Each phase builds upon previous capabilities while maintaining the core privacy-first principles that differentiate KagiNote from cloud-based competitors.
