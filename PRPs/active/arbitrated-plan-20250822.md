### Phase 3: Performance Optimization & Polish (Estimated: 2.5 hours)
**Strategy**: Alpha's thoroughness with Beta's practical delivery focus

**Tasks**:
1. **Performance Optimization** - Ensure no latency regression
   - Profile deduplication algorithms for real-time suitability
   - Implement caching for expensive similarity calculations
   - Add segment processing pipeline optimization
   - Memory usage optimization for longer sessions

2. **Quality Assurance** - Comprehensive validation without over-testing
   - Create test scenarios covering common duplicate patterns
