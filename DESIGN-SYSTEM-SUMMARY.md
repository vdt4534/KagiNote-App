- **Responsive design patterns** for different window sizes
- **Native integration points** (title bars, window controls, system fonts)

### 3. Professional User Focus
- **Business-appropriate aesthetics** suitable for workplace environments
- **High information density** without overwhelming complexity
- **Keyboard-first navigation** for power users
- **Export-friendly formats** for professional workflows

## Design System Architecture

### Color System
```css
Primary (Trust Blue):   #2563EB (600) - buttons, links, focus states
